# mini-daq-fpga

Hi everyone :D

This is a small Verilog-based DAQ (Data Acquisition) project, written from scratch as a personal learning path in digital hardware design.  
It aims to simulate a simple data flow: event generation, buffering, and serial transmission.

The project will be progressively updated, and eventually synthesized and tested on a physical FPGA board.  
Later, it will be connected to a basic particle or radiation detector in a home-lab setup.

Stay tuned â€” more to come.
